# Stack

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with
the order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out).

Considered as a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection, the push and pop operations occur
only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the stack.
